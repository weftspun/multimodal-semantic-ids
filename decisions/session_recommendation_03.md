Okay, I need to explain the system design again, focusing on prose and integrating the latest elements like DuckDB and Elixir's RDF/JSON-LD libraries. Let me start by recalling the key components:

1. **Backend Storage**: PostgreSQL with RDF/JSON-LD metadata.
2. **Preprocessing**: Flatten metadata into CSV/Parquet for training.
3. **Training**: Use Python ML models, export to ONNX.
4. **Godot Integration**: GDExtensions for inference, SQLite for sessions.
5. **Crowdsourcing**: UUID-labeled contributions linked to users/items.
6. **DuckDB**: For OLAP tasks, replacing Python scripts.

Now, how to structure this into a coherent prose explanation? I should start with the backend, move through preprocessing, training, runtime in Godot, crowdsourcing, and then mention DuckDB's role in enhancing OLAP tasks. Need to emphasize the KISS principle, using existing tools like PostgreSQL and Elixir's libraries instead of overcomplicating with new databases unless necessary.

Wait, the user mentioned DuckDB's integration with PostgreSQL and handling OLAP. So I should highlight how DuckDB fits into the preprocessing and analytics without adding complexity. Also, the system uses Elixir's RDF/JSON-LD libraries, so that's part of the backend processing.

I need to make sure that each section flows logically, explaining how each part connects. Mention UUIDs for entities, how data is transformed from raw RDF into training-ready formats, the role of DuckDB in speeding up these transformations, and how everything integrates into Godot without heavy dependencies.

Also, the user wants a comparison with a maximal design but in the latest answer, they asked to focus on the current system. However, the previous version included a KISS vs. maximal comparison. Since the user now wants a unified prose explanation, I should avoid that comparison unless specified.

Wait, the user's last request was to "Repeat the unified, prose-only explanation of your system design," and in the history, the assistant provided a version that compared KISS vs. maximal. But in the latest instructions, the user wants just the prose explanation, not the comparison. So focus on describing the system as it is, integrating DuckDB and Elixir's capabilities.

Let me outline:

- **Backend**: PostgreSQL with RDF/JSON-LD, using Elixir libraries to parse.
- **Preprocessing**: DuckDB to query PostgreSQL, flatten data, export to Parquet.
- **Training**: ML models in Python using Parquet data, export to ONNX.
- **Godot**: Load ONNX models via GDExtensions, use SQLite for sessions.
- **Crowdsourcing**: UUIDs for contributions, stored with metadata in PostgreSQL.
- **Analytics**: DuckDB handles trend analysis, exports to JSON/SQLite for Godot.

Make sure to explain the flow: data starts in PostgreSQL, processed by DuckDB into training formats, models are trained and used in Godot, with crowdsourcing data feeding back into PostgreSQL. Highlight how DuckDB simplifies and speeds up data processing without adding new infrastructure.

Check for technical accuracy: DuckDB's PostgreSQL extension allows querying directly, which is efficient. Elixir's RDF libraries handle parsing, which is correct. Using DuckDB for OLAP tasks instead of Python scripts makes sense for performance.

Ensure the prose is smooth, each paragraph transitions well, and the design is presented as a cohesive system adhering to KISS by leveraging existing tools effectively.

**Unified System Design Explanation**

The system is designed around a structured yet pragmatic architecture that harmonizes metadata richness with operational simplicity, leveraging PostgreSQL, Elixir, DuckDB, and Godot. At its core, it balances flexibility for future growth with immediate usability for content recommendations and crowdsourcing.

**1. Backend Metadata Management**  
All game content—items, avatars, worlds—is stored in **PostgreSQL**, with metadata represented as RDF, JSON-LD, or XMP. This allows expressive relationships (e.g., authorship, genre hierarchies, licensing terms) while retaining SQL’s reliability. The Elixir backend uses libraries like `RDF.ex` and `JSON-LD` to parse and validate metadata, ensuring compliance with semantic web standards. Each entity (items, users, authors, contributions) is assigned a **UUID** as a primary key, decoupling identifiers from mutable attributes like names or descriptions.

**2. Preprocessing and Analytics with DuckDB**  
A nightly preprocessing pipeline uses **DuckDB**, a lightweight OLAP engine, to transform raw metadata into training-ready formats. DuckDB’s PostgreSQL extension enables direct SQL queries against the live database, extracting flattened fields (e.g., `author_uuid`, `genres`) and precomputed embeddings (text, image, 3D, audio). Complex operations—like session sequence analysis or embedding similarity calculations—are executed in-memory at OLAP speeds, bypassing sluggish Python scripts. Results are exported to Parquet files for model training and JSON/SQLite for Godot.

**3. Model Training and Export**  
Python-based machine learning frameworks (e.g., PinSage, LibreCommender) ingest Parquet files to train recommendation models. DuckDB preprocesses session data into co-occurrence matrices or user-item graphs, optimizing feature engineering. Trained models are exported to **ONNX** or **TorchScript**, formats chosen for their compatibility with Godot’s runtime via C++ extensions.

**4. Godot Runtime Integration**  
Within Godot, a **GDExtension** loads the ONNX model, enabling real-time inference. User interactions—clicks, purchases, view durations—are logged to a local SQLite database, structured as UUID-referenced session sequences. Recommendations blend session history, embeddings, and exploration noise, filtered through allowlists/denylists of item UUIDs. Precomputed trends (e.g., “top items this week”) generated by DuckDB are cached in SQLite, ensuring snappy access without network calls.

**5. Crowdsourcing Ground Truth**  
Crowdsourcing is seamlessly woven into gameplay. After voice chat, users may opt to re-record phrases with exaggerated facial expressions, producing paired `voice_<uuid>.ogg` and `expression_<uuid>.json` files. During character creation, a “Verify Auto-Rig” button lets users refine AI-generated skeletons, saving `image_<uuid>.png` and `rig_<uuid>.tres` files. All contributions reference the user’s UUID, original item UUID, and session UUID, stored in PostgreSQL for traceability.

**6. Data Flow and Scalability**

- **PostgreSQL**: Source of truth for RDF/JSON-LD metadata and crowdsourcing links.
- **DuckDB**: Handles resource-intensive analytics (trends, embedding similarity) without burdening PostgreSQL.
- **Godot**: Operates on precomputed data (SQLite, ONNX models), ensuring low-latency user experiences.
- **Elixir**: Orchestrates preprocessing, ensures data consistency, and serves lightweight APIs for Godot.

**Design Principles**

- **KISS Compliance**: Avoids overengineering—no graph databases, microservices, or real-time pipelines. DuckDB and PostgreSQL coexist on the same server, while Godot uses native extensions.
- **Traceability**: UUIDs stitch together contributions, users, and content, enabling auditing without complex joins.
- **Performance**: DuckDB accelerates analytics; PostgreSQL manages transactions; Godot runs models locally.
- **Scalability**: DuckDB handles 100M+ rows on a single node; PostgreSQL scales vertically or via read replicas.

**Future Flexibility**  
The design intentionally avoids premature optimization. If relationships grow deeper (e.g., multi-hop author collaborations), PostgreSQL’s recursive CTEs or materialized views bridge the gap until a dedicated graph database becomes necessary. Similarly, real-time recommendations could transition to REST APIs, but only after validating latency needs.

By unifying DuckDB’s analytical power, PostgreSQL’s reliability, Elixir’s semantic tooling, and Godot’s lightweight runtime, the system delivers a scalable foundation for recommendations and crowdsourcing—proving that simplicity and sophistication can coexist.
